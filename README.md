# What I Find Interesting About The Article

*The article was really interesting to me being someone who wants to be a software developer in the future. While coding, I generally focus on accomplishing the problem at hand, following my own pattern of development.  However, this article reminded me of the general yet essential rules, which are very helpful to follow as a software developer. This article layed out factors relating to development, troubleshooting, cooperation, as well as other aspects such as experimentation, ultimately the key elements or general rules of thumb for software development. Therefore, I found this article to be super interesting, since it brought to light many of the aspects that could help me become a better software developer, details which I never considered.*

The most interesting thing to me about this article was how significant the non-coding aspects about development are. A few of the points made had to do with mindset– understanding that "there will always be bugs"– and good communication– "face to face has the highest bandwith" and "rubber-ducking." The article even goes onto talk about the significance of removing yourself from the work to sleep on it, before making decisions. So I guess there's a lot more to being a good developer than developing. Communication, awareness, and cooperation are also just as important as logging and error handling.

I find it interesting that this article highlighted some of the mistakes that I did when I programmed in my previous  
classes. For instance, the article urges to fix one problem at a time, or to assume no coincidences, both pieces of advice  
which are easy to not follow as newbies in coding and software development.  I also like the way the article  
describes how problems should be solved: making sure that the problem is actually what you think it is before fixing it.  
Furthermore, I find it interesting that it was highlighted that succeeding in software development entails  
non-coding aspects such as in-person discussions and sharing credit when applicable.
